# copy_on_create_folder
copy_on_create_folder is a simple [python](https://www.python.org/) command-line program that allows a user to copy all files from a base directory to a new directory on creation.

# Usage
Before running the program on command-line, make sure you update the following variables:
`from_path` (the location of the files to be copied),
`to_path` (the location of the new folder), and 
`placeholder` (a temporary name for the files to be copied, used in renaming)

From your console, go to thhe directory where this script is located and type the following command:
`python createFolder.py [new-folder-name]`
The new folder with the name `[new-folder-name]` should be created in the directory specified in `to-path`
